#### Project description: 
* Choose the state, input(s), dynamics, constraints and implement Model Predictive Control algorithm. The outputs of the algorithm are the steering angle and throttle acceleration which are applied to control the vehicle. The vehicle is able to drive successfully around the track.

	The implementation has been following to the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/896/view).

#### Model Predictive Control Algorithm
The algorithm includes the state, actuators and update equations, which are described as below.

##### The state:



##### The actuators:



##### The update equations:
